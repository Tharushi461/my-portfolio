        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="images/my.jpg.jpg" alt="Tharushi Nimesha" class="profile-img">

        <p> Hello everyone! My name is Tharushi Nimesha, and I’m from Nildandahinna, Sri Lanka. I am currently pursuing a Higher National Diploma in Software Engineering at Esoft Metro Campus, where I have developed a strong interest in technology and its transformative impact on our lives. My journey in software engineering has included hands-on experience in web development, particularly as an aspiring frontend developer skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with ongoing improvements in React and Tailwind CSS. Throughout my education, I have worked on challenging projects, including a hospital management system that provided me with valuable frontend and backend development experience using PHP, MySQL, and Bootstrap. My technical skills also extend to Java and Python for backend development, with notable projects like a Pizza Bill Generator and a database management system. Outside of academics, I am passionate about reading and run a YouTube channel called ‘BookBzz,’ where I review and discuss books like How to Win Friends and Influence People and Atomic Habits. Additionally, I create humorous content on my channel ‘LaughLab,’ which keeps me connected with my audience. My short-term goal is to secure an internship with leading companies such as the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) Technology or CodeGen International, while my long-term aspiration is to excel as a software engineer, particularly in Java development, with a focus on digital transformation and sustainability. I have conducted research on the impact of digital transformation on environmental sustainability, specifically in e-waste management strategies. I am excited about the future and look forward to growing both professionally and personally while maintaining my passion for technology and content creation. </p>
