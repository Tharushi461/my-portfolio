            <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h2>
            <p>Hello everyone! My name is Tharushi Nimesha, and I’m from Nildandahinna, Sri Lanka. I am currently pursuing a Higher National Diploma in Software Engineering at Esoft Metro Campus. Growing up, I developed a strong interest in technology, particularly in how it transforms the way we work and live. This passion led me to explore various aspects of software engineering, from web development to backend programming. I’m also an aspiring frontend developer with hands-on experience in web development. I’ve developed a solid foundation in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m constantly improving my skills in React and Tailwind CSS.

              My educational journey in software engineering has been an exciting one. At Esoft Metro Campus, I have had the opportunity to work on several challenging projects, which have helped me apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. My academic curriculum has allowed me to gain expertise in web development, database management, and programming languages such as Java and Python. One of the most impactful projects I worked on was a hospital management system. This project gave me hands-on experience in both frontend and backend development, using technologies like PHP, MySQL, and Bootstrap. The project also taught me the importance of user-centered design, as I had to consider both technical performance and user experience.
              
              Throughout my journey, I have built a variety of technical skills. As I mentioned earlier, my strengths lie in frontend development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have experience working with Java and Python for backend development. I’ve created projects like a Pizza Bill Generator using Java and built responsive websites using Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS. I’ve also developed my knowledge of databases, including MySQL, which I used in multiple projects, such as building a 'Pizza DB' for an ordering system. Additionally, I’ve become familiar with frameworks like Laravel, and I’m currently deepening my understanding of React. In terms of web responsiveness, I’m particularly interested in container queries and how they can improve responsive web design. Moreover, I have always been keen to learn about new technologies, which is why I’m exploring the use of React for more complex interactive designs and improving user interfaces.
              
              Outside of my professional and academic life, I have a passion for reading. Books are a big part of my life, and I’ve even created a YouTube channel called ‘BookBzz’ where I review and discuss books. Two of the books I’ve reviewed are ‘How to Win Friends and Influence People’ and ‘Atomic Habits.’ These books not only inspire me but also help me in my personal and professional development by improving my communication skills and productivity. Another hobby of mine is creating engaging and humorous content for YouTube. I run a channel called ‘LaughLab’ where I share light-hearted, funny videos, which helps me stay creative and connected with my audience.
              
              My short-term goal is to secure an internship that will allow me to apply and further develop my skills as a software engineer. I’m particularly interested in joining leading companies or  software engineering firms . where I can contribute to cutting-edge projects and learn from industry experts. In the long term, I aspire to become a successful software engineer, particularly in Java development. I am also passionate about digital transformation, especially in how it can drive sustainability. In fact, I have conducted research on the impact of digital transformation on environmental sustainability, with a focus on e-waste management strategies in Sampath Bank.
              
              In conclusion, my journey in software engineering has been incredibly rewarding so far, and I’m excited about the future. With my strong foundation in web development, programming languages, and database management, I am confident that I can make meaningful contributions to any project I work on. I look forward to continuing to grow both professionally and personally, while keeping my passion for reading and content creation alive. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share my story, and I am more than happy to answer any questions you may have.</p>
